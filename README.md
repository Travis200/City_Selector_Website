#City Selector Website

##About
This project was created by following and adapting a youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk). This was done to check my understanding of the React fundamentals. This mini project also gave me some exposure to using bootstrap.

##Run
Assuming you have npm installed run the following commands:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
